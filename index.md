The Research Network is an open-membership, multi-sector, professional learning community for early- to mid-career researchers in child development, education, policy and related social sciences. Members are from local universities, research institutions, non-profits, K12 districts, cities, King County and Washington State government. This informal group meets quarterly with the goal of learning, discussing methodology, sharing current studies, uplifting opportunities for collaboration, centering racial equity and communities of color, and producing information for action. This site serves as a resource hub.
