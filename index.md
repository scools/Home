The Research Network is an open-membership, multi-sector, professional learning community for early-career researchers in child development, education and related social sciences. Members are from local universities, research institutions, non-profits, K12 districts, cities, King County and Washington State government. Meetings are held monthly every third Thursday from 2-4pm with the goal of learning, discussing methodology, sharing current studies, uplifting opportunities for collaboration, centering racial equity, impacted communities and communities of color and producing information for action. This site serves as a collaboration tool and resource hub.
